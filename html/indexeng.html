            How well do you know the Percy Jackson universe? This quiz will take you from the cabins at Camp Half-Blood all the way to Olympus.
<br>
<br>
Here are some of the areas your knowlage will be challenged in:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
<b>Characters: </b> Do you know your demigods, mortals, and monsters? Who belongs to which cabin? Who is the antagonist?</li>
<li>
<b>Plot and Prophecies: </b>Do you remember the prophecy Percy received? Who does Luke help, and with what? What was stolen?</li>
<li>
<b>Mythology meets modern day: </b> IIn the world of Percy Jackson, Greek myths blend with the modern world. Do you remember where the entrance to Olympus is? Or which labyrinth is especially important?</li>
<li>
<b>Magical Items: </b>Riptide, the Helm of Darkness, the Master Bolt - magical artifacts play a big role. Do you remember who used what, and when?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>
 Treat it like a quest. You may not have ambrosia or nectar on hand (though snacks never hurt), but you have your mind, your memory, and maybe a few satyrs cheering you on from the side. Trust your instincts. When in doubt, ask yourself: <i>What would Annabeth do?</i>
</p><br>
Remember: Just like in the books, there are many ways to be a hero. Maybe you recall every tiny detail about Annabeth’s growth. Or maybe you just love Greek mythology and enjoy catching all the references. Whatever your strength is – you’ve got what it takes to conquer this quiz.
